 The deriver document is both data and an intermediary between the three data panes (the journal,
 the proof, and the drawing).


 The deriver document has all the data (conceptually a file). There is a browser that
 looks at the data. One browser can change data from one document to another document, or you can
 have several browsers each with their own data
